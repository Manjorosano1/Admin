            Jack Ma Yun (born September 10, 1964) is a Chinese business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is the co-founder of Alibaba Group, a multinational technology conglomerate. Ma is also the co-founder of Yunfeng Capital, a Chinese private equity firm. As of February 2024, with a net worth of $30.1 billion, Ma is the sixth-wealthiest person in China and the 50th wealthiest person in the world, ranked by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
            <br><br>
            Born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Ma earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988. He became an English lecturer at Hangzhou Dianzi University. The rise of the internet captured his attention, leading him to start his first business in 1994. In 1999, he co-founded Alibaba Group, initially a B2B marketplace, which later expanded across various industries in China.
            <br><br>
            In 2017, Ma was ranked second in Fortune's "World's 50 Greatest Leaders." He has been a global ambassador for Chinese businesses and startups. In 2018, he announced his retirement from Alibaba to focus on philanthropy, education, and environmental causes. In 2019, Forbes listed him among "Asia's Heroes of Philanthropy" for his charitable work in China and beyond.
            <br><br>
            In 2020, the Chinese government halted the IPO of his digital payment company, Ant Group, following a critical speech he made about Chinese regulators. Despite these setbacks, Ma remains an influential figure in global business and philanthropy.
            <br><br>
            Maâ€™s early life involved struggles, including poor academic performance and rejections from universities and job applications. Despite these challenges, his determination to learn English and his encounters with foreign tourists shaped his worldview and entrepreneurial spirit.
