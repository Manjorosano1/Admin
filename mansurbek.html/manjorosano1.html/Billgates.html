            William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate best known for co-founding the software company Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief software architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
            <br><br>
            Gates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates led the company as its chairman and CEO until stepping down in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board and became chief software architect. He transitioned into part-time work at Microsoft in 2008 and focused on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
            <br><br>
            Gates is one of the world's most prominent philanthropists, having donated billions of dollars to charitable causes through his foundation. He and his then-wife Melinda established the foundation in 2000. In March 2020, Gates left his positions on the Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway boards to concentrate fully on philanthropy, focusing on issues such as global health, climate change, and education.
            <br><br>
            He has been consistently listed among the world's wealthiest people, holding the top spot for many years. Gates has also played a key role in eradicating diseases like wild poliovirus in Africa through his foundation's vaccination efforts. He is also the co-founder of the Giving Pledge, encouraging billionaires to donate a significant portion of their wealth.
